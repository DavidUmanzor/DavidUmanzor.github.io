							<h4><p>Summer 2021</p></h4>
							<p>In this project we study the ability of an AI to recognize letters from the American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet. We use a Convolutional Neural Network and apply it to a dataset of hands in different positionings showing the letters 'a', 'b', and 'c' in ASL. With this we build a model to recognize the letter and output the letter it predicts.</p>
							<p>We use two sources of datasets, the first is from kaggle which it was already prepared but we needed more. The second is self made dataset by take images in good lighting against a white wall, it was then cropped to 400x400 pixels focused on the hand. The program then sets the images to grayscale as the color is not needed for this research. Finally, the images are reduced to 50x50 resolution for the AI to use for training.</p>

							<h4><p>Fall 2021</p></h4>
							<p>In this project we study the ability of an AI to recognize spam text messages. We use a Natural Language Processing model and apply it to a dataset of 5000 text messages, we build a model to recognize the frequency of key words and assign weight to the output then it predicts between spam or no-spam.</p>
							<h5><p>What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)</p></h5>
							<p>The use of algorithms to determine properties of natural, human language so that computers can understand what humans have written or said. NLP includes teaching computer systems how to extract data from bodies of written text, translate from one language to another, and recognize printed or handwritten words. Notably, NLP is the field that allows for our everyday use of virtual assistants such as Siri.</p>
